Alternative splicing event annotation for Human (hg19)
}
\description{
List of data frames containing alternative splicing events per event type. Each
splicing event is characterised by its chromosome, strand, splice junctions
coordinates relevant to the type of event and associated gene.

The following event types are available:
\itemize{
    \item{Skipped Exon (SE)}
    \item{Mutually Exclusive Exon (MXE)}
    \item{Alternative First Exon (AFE)}
    \item{Alternative Last Exon (ALE)}
    \item{Alternative 3' Splice Site (A3SS)}
    \item{Alternative 5' Splice Site (A5SS)}
    \item{Retained Intron (RI)}
    \item{Tandem UTR}
}

The splicing events were compiled from the annotation files used by the
alternative splicing quantification tools MISO, VAST-TOOLS, SUPPA and rMATS (see
details).

%  The format is: chr "data/alternativeSplicingEvents.hg19.RDS"
}
\details{
The annotation files from MISO and VAST-TOLLS were retrieved from the links
in "Sources". SUPPA and rMATS identify alternative splicing events and generate
annotation files from a transcripts annotation file in GTF format.

The transcripts annotation file used was retrieved from UCSC Table Browser by
selecting the GRCh37/hg19 assembly, "Genes and Gene Predictions" group, "UCSC
Genes" track, "knownGene"" table for all genome in the GTF format.
Unfortunately, this file has a bug where the "transcript_id" is the same as the
"gene_id". To fix the transcripts' identifier from the GTF file, the exact same
information was retrieved from UCSC Table Browser in TXT format and the
following R script was run:
\url{https://gist.github.com/nuno-agostinho/24a5e4926b6e08e988c0}

After obtaining the resulting annotation files, all files were parsed to obtain
the identifier, chromosome, strand and coordinates of each splicing event per
event type. Then, a full outer join was performed on the annotation of the
different programs per event type using \code{dplyr::full_join}.

Note that before the outer join, some rMATS coordinates should increment one
unit to be compared to the annotation of other files and the "chr" prefix
present in the chromosome field of some annotation files was also removed.
